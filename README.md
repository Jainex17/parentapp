Recommendation Engine:
The recommendation engine houses functions that go from fetching data from our platform, preprocessing the data, feeding it to our hybrid recommendation algorithm and returning a list of recommended posts. It houses 2 functions:

1. every_n_hours() - a function meant to run periodically that processes large scale data in order to be used at the time of recommendation. Running this function results in new files being created and stored that are necessary for the user_recommendation() function. This function returns True on successful execution.

2. user_recommendation() - a function that is called at the time of recommendation of posts to a user. It accepts one parameter, being the username of the user to recommend posts for. The function runs the algorithm and returns a list of jsons representing posts that can directly be rendered in the front end on the for you page.
